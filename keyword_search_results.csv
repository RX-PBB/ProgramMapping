Crime Prevention Administration (General Department Expenditures):
Administration encompasses all administrative type expenses as well as all general department costs that do not fall under one specific program. The wages of the Program Manager, the Executive Assistant, and the Program Analyst fall under the Administration budget code. Department training and development directed at all Crime Prevention staff, as well as the resource library costs are included in this. Community mobilization and engagement fall under the category of administration; examples of this, can include involvement in community collaborations such as finding solutions to issues around the Parkside Inn - this community effort involves Crime Prevention, the RCMP, Enforcement Services, Housing First Initiatives, HIV North and many others.  

Conversation Café’s:
 Conversation Cafés foster discussions with either a neighbourhood or group of individuals with a common crime/safety concern. Crime Prevention facilitates the cafés and invites the appropriate resources to the table; the invitees are dependant on the nature of the concerns. The cafes are about Crime Prevention responding to the needs of the group by engaging in dialogue with them about their crime-related concerns. Examples of past Conversation Café topics include: armed robbery, theft, vehicle break ins, drugs, and neighbourhood policing priorities. Crime Prevention and other invited agencies can respond to questions and collectively establish community-driven solutions. This has been a largely a grass roots initiative where the community will be the party to indicate a desire to come together with the relevant local authorities/agencies. On a quarterly basis, a Conversation Café will be initiated with a selected neighbourhood in the city based on available policing data/crime stats. These opportunities for dialogue promote engagement across the residents that are directly impacted by given issue. The cafés can be hosted at a location in the given neighbourhood or at the Crime Prevention office.

Committees:
Crime Prevention Committees were formed to meet the needs of community following  a consultation with agencies, businesses and community members. 
The consultation resulted in identifying the following four root causes of crime: 
1. Substance Use and Abuse
2. Breakdown of the Family Unit
3. Lack of Community Connectedness
4. Bullying and Family Violence
The committees are formed to meet ongoing needs and can be dissolved once the goals for safer community have been met. All committees are facilitated by the Crime Prevention Manager. Proactively, the committees can deter crimes and the challenges that crime can have on families, businesses and the city as a whole.
• The Responsible Hospitality Committee meets to address the concerns and challenges faced by Grande Prairie’s hospitality industry including drinking establishments, hotels, and taxi cab companies. The aim is to share information and establish collective approaches to maximizing the safety and security of staff, patrons, and clients. 

• The Outreach Workers Committee allows agencies that provide services to Grande Prairie’s street engaged population, to come together on a monthly basis to stay informed of any concerns that may exist, any hotspots for crime, and general criminal and drug activity occurring across the city. The Committee discusses the status of specific individuals in Grande Prairie’s street engaged populations. By reporting and checking in monthly, the Committee aims to keep apprised of what is happening and to keep ahead of some of the reported problem areas.

• The Crime Prevention Committee is a group of service providers and individuals committed to preventing crime, supporting fellow agencies and building community confidence that crime is preventable, can be dealt with through collaborative effort, education, and increased public awareness. 

Crime Prevention is defined as comprising strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring and their potential harmful effects on individuals and community, including fear of crime, by intervening to influence their multiple causes.

• Peace Area Drug Awareness Coalition was formed as a result of the opioid crisis to provide educational sessions and events to the public. At present, the Coalition’s mandate is expanding to include education and events on all substances;  this is to address Grande Prairie’s primary root cause of crime being substance use and abuse.

Volunteer Management:
Crime Prevention has a strong volunteer base, which allows the Department to maximize its program and service delivery to the community, even in times of limited resources.  Crime Prevention volunteers are an essential part of the Department’s successful operation. Volunteers have a passion for crime prevention and for making a positive difference in community, they act as local advocates for Crime Prevention programs, and help with marketing of events. 
The management of volunteers includes recruitment and coordination; volunteers undergo a hiring process including an interview, reference checks, and in some instances the completion of criminal record and intervention checks. Annual follow-ups with each volunteer takes place, training is offered periodically, and active volunteers are invited to an annual recognition event. 
Individuals of all ages volunteer with Crime Prevention including youth and seniors. Volunteering can take place in office or out in community. Volunteers help out with a range of activities such as weekly administrative tasks, helping run the resource library, set up/take down for the Cultural Integration Academy Educational sessions and childcare (while the latter is taking place). The set up/take down and registration for our monthly Lunch and Learns, preparation for tradeshows, performing safety audits and assisting with reporting, and helping to run community events such as neighbourhood BBQs. 
A number of Crime Prevention volunteers sit on various internal committees as well (i.e. the Crime Prevention Committee, the Peace Area Drug Awareness Coalition, the Annual Conference Planning Committee, and the Grande Prairie Intercultural Association, which was started under the Crime Prevention umbrella). 
Success as a City department, is in large thanks to the wonderful team of volunteers.

Community BBQ’s:
Crime Prevention will host neighbourhood BBQ events as a community connection activity. The aim is to develop community connections and contribute to building strong families, two key aspects to effectively preventing crime. Connections are fostered across the community, with activities for all age groups. 

National Addictions Awareness Week (NAAW):
For National Addictions Awareness Week (NAAW), Crime Prevention hosts a dinner at the Salvation Army for the high risk, street engaged community and vulnerable population in Grande Prairie. Encouraging inclusiveness and a sense of welcoming to all. Partner agencies and the RCMP attend the dinner to help with meal preparations and serving. The agencies, along with Crime Prevention, staff mingle with the individuals attending the dinner; this serves as an opportunity to connect with the street engaged population through meaningful dialogue, to gather information, and learn from the personal stories shared.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design programs look at early stage development plans, existing infrastructure, and consider the tangible changes that can be made to a physical space or object that can help to prevent or reduce the occurrences of crime at that site/area. 
Safety Audits (And the Review of Development and Subdivision Circulations):
 Safety audits can be conducted with any requesting business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association that want to enhance the safety of their site or area. A Safety audit is a tool to evaluate a physical a space with the goal of reducing crime and improving safety; 14 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles are used as the framework for the safety audits. Crime Prevention, as lead, along with business owners, staff, neighbourhood teams, and residents inspect the location together (e.g. its design, activity occurring in the space, users of the area, etc) and any adjacent areas. Actual crime as well as the perceived threat of crime are both taken into consideration; crime statistics as well as surveys are used to acquire this knowledge. Inspections of the site/area are done during the day and again at night and include a behavioural audit. Safety audits always include active engagement from the business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association; safety audits are not simply to improve the immediate safety of the site but also serve to teach people how to implement the principles on their own. A final report is prepared after each safety audit with recommendations and is presented to the requesting party.
Crime Prevention also reviews all proposed City Development Circulations to ensure that the principles of CPTED are met in the early stages of planning, development, and construction phases. 

GP HEAT:
Crime Prevention, Enforcement Services, the RCMP, and community volunteers team up to help prevent automobile theft. With the goal of prevention through education, GP HEAT helps to inform the public on how they can better protect their vehicles and valuables from theft. GP HEAT teams target commercial and residential areas to distribute Crime Prevention notices to all vehicles in that given area.  These notices provide general tips on how to reduce the likelihood of theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles. The notices also indicate whether each vehicle is an easy or a hard target – this allows the owner of the vehicle to learn about what a thief may consider when choosing their target. By providing vehicle-specific information, owners receive concrete direction on how they can better protect their possessions.

The Best Bar None:
 The Best Bar None is an Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC) program that Crime Prevention administers in Grande Prairie. Crime Prevention spear-heads the program, coordinates, and leads a local team of assessors that includes the RCMP, the Fire Department, and Enforcement Services. Grande Prairie is one of four cities in Alberta currently supporting the program. The program is a voluntary accreditation program recognizing excellence in Alberta’s liquor service industry. Participating establishments include bars, pubs, and clubs, lounges, casinos, restaurant lounges, and post-secondary drinking establishments. The Best Bar None aims to reduce alcohol-related incidences and enhance the safety of staff, patrons, and neighbouring residents/businesses. 
The team evaluates each establishment based on set criteria (e.g. safety procedures, capacity limits, staff training, building design, etc) that are established by the AGLC. The AGLC scores the team’s assessment of the criteria to determine if the establishment passes and can receive an accreditation. The final scores are presented to a steering committee who selects winners; the program recognizes and rewards the liquor service establishments that meet a higher standard of operation and safety. A recognition and accreditation presentation event is hosted annually. 

Neighbourhood Eye:
 The Neighbourhood Eye is a joint program between Crime Prevention and Neighbourhood Associations; it is a walking neighbourhood patrol initiative that allows residents to contribute to the prevention of crime and the general enhancement of their neighbourhoods. Individuals can identify anything that is not working, broken such as sidewalks needing repair, or is concerning including graffiti or suspicious activity.   Crime Prevention is the primary resource to the residents and can provide information and education when needed. Reporting is funnelled through Crime Prevention to either be addressed by one of Crime Prevention’s programs or disseminated to other resources such as the RCMP, Transportation, and Enforcement Services, etc. 

Graffiti Management Program:
 The graffiti Management Program is a joint initiative between Enforcement Services and Crime Prevention; through education and enforcement, the aim of the program is to reduce the amount of graffiti across the city and to help the identify taggers. A graffiti hotline and mobile app. (ARC) allows citizens to report areas that have been tagged with graffiti. Crime Prevention administers the program by receiving calls, collecting and compiling the data, and providing education to businesses and the broader community on what graffiti is, the importance of graffiti removal, and how to remove it.  Collected data is reviewed by Enforcement Services for further action. A mapping component allows for the locations of and patterns in the graffiti to be tracked. 

Utility Box Beautification Program:
 The Utility Box Beautification Program aims to deter graffiti, by covering what is considered to be a blank canvas for graffiti, and to beautify the community. The art selected to cover the City owned utility cabinets originates from local artists and photographers. Crime Prevention puts the call out to the community for art and photography. Submissions are reviewed/vetted and then presented to the Community Enhancement Advisory Committee and the Crime Prevention Committee to make the final selection.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166
