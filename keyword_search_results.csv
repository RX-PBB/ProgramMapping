Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design programs look at early stage development plans, existing infrastructure, and consider the tangible changes that can be made to a physical space or object that can help to prevent or reduce the occurrences of crime at that site/area. 
Safety Audits (And the Review of Development and Subdivision Circulations):
 Safety audits can be conducted with any requesting business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association that want to enhance the safety of their site or area. A Safety audit is a tool to evaluate a physical a space with the goal of reducing crime and improving safety; 14 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles are used as the framework for the safety audits. Crime Prevention, as lead, along with business owners, staff, neighbourhood teams, and residents inspect the location together (e.g. its design, activity occurring in the space, users of the area, etc) and any adjacent areas. Actual crime as well as the perceived threat of crime are both taken into consideration; crime statistics as well as surveys are used to acquire this knowledge. Inspections of the site/area are done during the day and again at night and include a behavioural audit. Safety audits always include active engagement from the business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association; safety audits are not simply to improve the immediate safety of the site but also serve to teach people how to implement the principles on their own. A final report is prepared after each safety audit with recommendations and is presented to the requesting party.
Crime Prevention also reviews all proposed City Development Circulations to ensure that the principles of CPTED are met in the early stages of planning, development, and construction phases. 

GP HEAT:
Crime Prevention, Enforcement Services, the RCMP, and community volunteers team up to help prevent automobile theft. With the goal of prevention through education, GP HEAT helps to inform the public on how they can better protect their vehicles and valuables from theft. GP HEAT teams target commercial and residential areas to distribute Crime Prevention notices to all vehicles in that given area.  These notices provide general tips on how to reduce the likelihood of theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles. The notices also indicate whether each vehicle is an easy or a hard target – this allows the owner of the vehicle to learn about what a thief may consider when choosing their target. By providing vehicle-specific information, owners receive concrete direction on how they can better protect their possessions.

The Best Bar None:
 The Best Bar None is an Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC) program that Crime Prevention administers in Grande Prairie. Crime Prevention spear-heads the program, coordinates, and leads a local team of assessors that includes the RCMP, the Fire Department, and Enforcement Services. Grande Prairie is one of four cities in Alberta currently supporting the program. The program is a voluntary accreditation program recognizing excellence in Alberta’s liquor service industry. Participating establishments include bars, pubs, and clubs, lounges, casinos, restaurant lounges, and post-secondary drinking establishments. The Best Bar None aims to reduce alcohol-related incidences and enhance the safety of staff, patrons, and neighbouring residents/businesses. 
The team evaluates each establishment based on set criteria (e.g. safety procedures, capacity limits, staff training, building design, etc) that are established by the AGLC. The AGLC scores the team’s assessment of the criteria to determine if the establishment passes and can receive an accreditation. The final scores are presented to a steering committee who selects winners; the program recognizes and rewards the liquor service establishments that meet a higher standard of operation and safety. A recognition and accreditation presentation event is hosted annually. 

Neighbourhood Eye:
 The Neighbourhood Eye is a joint program between Crime Prevention and Neighbourhood Associations; it is a walking neighbourhood patrol initiative that allows residents to contribute to the prevention of crime and the general enhancement of their neighbourhoods. Individuals can identify anything that is not working, broken such as sidewalks needing repair, or is concerning including graffiti or suspicious activity.   Crime Prevention is the primary resource to the residents and can provide information and education when needed. Reporting is funnelled through Crime Prevention to either be addressed by one of Crime Prevention’s programs or disseminated to other resources such as the RCMP, Transportation, and Enforcement Services, etc. 

Graffiti Management Program:
 The graffiti Management Program is a joint initiative between Enforcement Services and Crime Prevention; through education and enforcement, the aim of the program is to reduce the amount of graffiti across the city and to help the identify taggers. A graffiti hotline and mobile app. (ARC) allows citizens to report areas that have been tagged with graffiti. Crime Prevention administers the program by receiving calls, collecting and compiling the data, and providing education to businesses and the broader community on what graffiti is, the importance of graffiti removal, and how to remove it.  Collected data is reviewed by Enforcement Services for further action. A mapping component allows for the locations of and patterns in the graffiti to be tracked. 

Utility Box Beautification Program:
 The Utility Box Beautification Program aims to deter graffiti, by covering what is considered to be a blank canvas for graffiti, and to beautify the community. The art selected to cover the City owned utility cabinets originates from local artists and photographers. Crime Prevention puts the call out to the community for art and photography. Submissions are reviewed/vetted and then presented to the Community Enhancement Advisory Committee and the Crime Prevention Committee to make the final selection.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

Crime Prevention Administration (General Department Expenditures):
Administration encompasses all administrative type expenses as well as all general department costs that do not fall under one specific program. The wages of the Program Manager, the Executive Assistant, and the Program Analyst fall under the Administration budget code. Department training and development directed at all Crime Prevention staff, as well as the resource library costs are included in this. Community mobilization and engagement fall under the category of administration; examples of this, can include involvement in community collaborations such as finding solutions to issues around the Parkside Inn - this community effort involves Crime Prevention, the RCMP, Enforcement Services, Housing First Initiatives, HIV North and many others.  

Conversation Café’s:
 Conversation Cafés foster discussions with either a neighbourhood or group of individuals with a common crime/safety concern. Crime Prevention facilitates the cafés and invites the appropriate resources to the table; the invitees are dependant on the nature of the concerns. The cafes are about Crime Prevention responding to the needs of the group by engaging in dialogue with them about their crime-related concerns. Examples of past Conversation Café topics include: armed robbery, theft, vehicle break ins, drugs, and neighbourhood policing priorities. Crime Prevention and other invited agencies can respond to questions and collectively establish community-driven solutions. This has been a largely a grass roots initiative where the community will be the party to indicate a desire to come together with the relevant local authorities/agencies. On a quarterly basis, a Conversation Café will be initiated with a selected neighbourhood in the city based on available policing data/crime stats. These opportunities for dialogue promote engagement across the residents that are directly impacted by given issue. The cafés can be hosted at a location in the given neighbourhood or at the Crime Prevention office.

Committees:
Crime Prevention Committees were formed to meet the needs of community following  a consultation with agencies, businesses and community members. 
The consultation resulted in identifying the following four root causes of crime: 
1. Substance Use and Abuse
2. Breakdown of the Family Unit
3. Lack of Community Connectedness
4. Bullying and Family Violence
The committees are formed to meet ongoing needs and can be dissolved once the goals for safer community have been met. All committees are facilitated by the Crime Prevention Manager. Proactively, the committees can deter crimes and the challenges that crime can have on families, businesses and the city as a whole.
• The Responsible Hospitality Committee meets to address the concerns and challenges faced by Grande Prairie’s hospitality industry including drinking establishments, hotels, and taxi cab companies. The aim is to share information and establish collective approaches to maximizing the safety and security of staff, patrons, and clients. 

• The Outreach Workers Committee allows agencies that provide services to Grande Prairie’s street engaged population, to come together on a monthly basis to stay informed of any concerns that may exist, any hotspots for crime, and general criminal and drug activity occurring across the city. The Committee discusses the status of specific individuals in Grande Prairie’s street engaged populations. By reporting and checking in monthly, the Committee aims to keep apprised of what is happening and to keep ahead of some of the reported problem areas.

• The Crime Prevention Committee is a group of service providers and individuals committed to preventing crime, supporting fellow agencies and building community confidence that crime is preventable, can be dealt with through collaborative effort, education, and increased public awareness. 

Crime Prevention is defined as comprising strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring and their potential harmful effects on individuals and community, including fear of crime, by intervening to influence their multiple causes.

• Peace Area Drug Awareness Coalition was formed as a result of the opioid crisis to provide educational sessions and events to the public. At present, the Coalition’s mandate is expanding to include education and events on all substances;  this is to address Grande Prairie’s primary root cause of crime being substance use and abuse.

Volunteer Management:
Crime Prevention has a strong volunteer base, which allows the Department to maximize its program and service delivery to the community, even in times of limited resources.  Crime Prevention volunteers are an essential part of the Department’s successful operation. Volunteers have a passion for crime prevention and for making a positive difference in community, they act as local advocates for Crime Prevention programs, and help with marketing of events. 
The management of volunteers includes recruitment and coordination; volunteers undergo a hiring process including an interview, reference checks, and in some instances the completion of criminal record and intervention checks. Annual follow-ups with each volunteer takes place, training is offered periodically, and active volunteers are invited to an annual recognition event. 
Individuals of all ages volunteer with Crime Prevention including youth and seniors. Volunteering can take place in office or out in community. Volunteers help out with a range of activities such as weekly administrative tasks, helping run the resource library, set up/take down for the Cultural Integration Academy Educational sessions and childcare (while the latter is taking place). The set up/take down and registration for our monthly Lunch and Learns, preparation for tradeshows, performing safety audits and assisting with reporting, and helping to run community events such as neighbourhood BBQs. 
A number of Crime Prevention volunteers sit on various internal committees as well (i.e. the Crime Prevention Committee, the Peace Area Drug Awareness Coalition, the Annual Conference Planning Committee, and the Grande Prairie Intercultural Association, which was started under the Crime Prevention umbrella). 
Success as a City department, is in large thanks to the wonderful team of volunteers.

Community BBQ’s:
Crime Prevention will host neighbourhood BBQ events as a community connection activity. The aim is to develop community connections and contribute to building strong families, two key aspects to effectively preventing crime. Connections are fostered across the community, with activities for all age groups. 

National Addictions Awareness Week (NAAW):
For National Addictions Awareness Week (NAAW), Crime Prevention hosts a dinner at the Salvation Army for the high risk, street engaged community and vulnerable population in Grande Prairie. Encouraging inclusiveness and a sense of welcoming to all. Partner agencies and the RCMP attend the dinner to help with meal preparations and serving. The agencies, along with Crime Prevention, staff mingle with the individuals attending the dinner; this serves as an opportunity to connect with the street engaged population through meaningful dialogue, to gather information, and learn from the personal stories shared.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

The programs are aimed at reinforcing outstanding characteristics and addressing the root causes behind behavioural issues in order to decrease the likelihood of future criminal involvement.  

Child and Youth Intervention Program:
The Child and Youth Intervention Program (CYIP) supports vulnerable children and youth at risk of criminal involvement and entering the criminal justice system. This is done by working with the individuals, connecting their families to resources in the community, helping to establish healthy relationships and empowering them to make positive life choices. By providing the parents with tools and knowledge, this allows them to not only better support the child going through the CYIP but any siblings as well. The consequences of breaking the law or of continuing down a current destructive path can be explained to the youth and their parents.  CYIP can provide assistance navigating the courts or can serve as a diversion program working with Probation, depending on the circumstances of the client. On an adhoc basis, CYIP can also contribute to providing wrap-around services for specific youth that have been identified within the community as being an extremely high risk to offend.
The RCMP, parents, schools and other community agencies refer children and youth to CYIP. CYIP’s role is then to provide crisis management, assessments, and make referrals to the appropriate community partners based on individual client’s needs. The formal assessment tools that are used include the YLS.CMI and 40 Developmental Assets; other tools are researched and implemented when appropriate or when the industry best practices change. Underlying issues identified through the assessments can include, but are not limited to, substance use and abuse, mental health concerns, family conflict, conflict with the law, abuse, homelessness, bullying, breakdown of the family, and lack of connections to the community. Referrals can be made to community partners for services such as counselling, support groups, housing, detox, schooling alternatives, recreation, financial guidance, employment, etc. In working with the children, youth, and families, the aim is both to prevent youth crime and to provide the necessary foundations to avoid potential future criminal involvement as adults.

Bullying Bylaw:
A bullying Bylaw exists in Grande Prairie that can be enforced through fines. An alternative option, to a monetary fine, is for the child/youth to be diverted to CYIP; this approach aims to address the underlying issues and put the right supports into place for the individual and their family in order to modify future behaviour. If the child/youth agrees to enter the Child and Youth Intervention program then the ticket is withdrawn. 

Positive Ticket: 
Positive Tickets recognize positive actions within the community. The program helps children and youth in the community build attributes of good citizenship by rewarding their positive acts. An additional outcome of the program is building and strengthening relationships between the children and law enforcement/other authority figures. The RCMP, Enforcement Services, and other partner agencies such as schools hand out the tickets when they see individuals contributing to our community in a positive manner. As an example, the more positive character traits, known as developmental assets, that are present in a young person, the less likely they are to engage in criminal behaviour later in life. Positive Tickets can be given to individuals as a way of reinforcing these asset traits and helping to develop outstanding adults.  Positive tickets can be issued for being positive, responsible, involved, dependable, respectful, and volunteering in the community. Recipients can come into the Crime Prevention office to redeem a prize of their choice selected from a bin of exciting items donated by local businesses.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

Fleet authorizes the repair, the repair is completed and fleet pays for the repair and all associated expenses.

Crime Prevention Administration (General Department Expenditures):
Administration encompasses all administrative type expenses as well as all general department costs that do not fall under one specific program. The wages of the Program Manager, the Executive Assistant, and the Program Analyst fall under the Administration budget code. Department training and development directed at all Crime Prevention staff, as well as the resource library costs are included in this. Community mobilization and engagement fall under the category of administration; examples of this, can include involvement in community collaborations such as finding solutions to issues around the Parkside Inn - this community effort involves Crime Prevention, the RCMP, Enforcement Services, Housing First Initiatives, HIV North and many others.  

Conversation Café’s:
 Conversation Cafés foster discussions with either a neighbourhood or group of individuals with a common crime/safety concern. Crime Prevention facilitates the cafés and invites the appropriate resources to the table; the invitees are dependant on the nature of the concerns. The cafes are about Crime Prevention responding to the needs of the group by engaging in dialogue with them about their crime-related concerns. Examples of past Conversation Café topics include: armed robbery, theft, vehicle break ins, drugs, and neighbourhood policing priorities. Crime Prevention and other invited agencies can respond to questions and collectively establish community-driven solutions. This has been a largely a grass roots initiative where the community will be the party to indicate a desire to come together with the relevant local authorities/agencies. On a quarterly basis, a Conversation Café will be initiated with a selected neighbourhood in the city based on available policing data/crime stats. These opportunities for dialogue promote engagement across the residents that are directly impacted by given issue. The cafés can be hosted at a location in the given neighbourhood or at the Crime Prevention office.

Committees:
Crime Prevention Committees were formed to meet the needs of community following  a consultation with agencies, businesses and community members. 
The consultation resulted in identifying the following four root causes of crime: 
1. Substance Use and Abuse
2. Breakdown of the Family Unit
3. Lack of Community Connectedness
4. Bullying and Family Violence
The committees are formed to meet ongoing needs and can be dissolved once the goals for safer community have been met. All committees are facilitated by the Crime Prevention Manager. Proactively, the committees can deter crimes and the challenges that crime can have on families, businesses and the city as a whole.
• The Responsible Hospitality Committee meets to address the concerns and challenges faced by Grande Prairie’s hospitality industry including drinking establishments, hotels, and taxi cab companies. The aim is to share information and establish collective approaches to maximizing the safety and security of staff, patrons, and clients. 

• The Outreach Workers Committee allows agencies that provide services to Grande Prairie’s street engaged population, to come together on a monthly basis to stay informed of any concerns that may exist, any hotspots for crime, and general criminal and drug activity occurring across the city. The Committee discusses the status of specific individuals in Grande Prairie’s street engaged populations. By reporting and checking in monthly, the Committee aims to keep apprised of what is happening and to keep ahead of some of the reported problem areas.

• The Crime Prevention Committee is a group of service providers and individuals committed to preventing crime, supporting fellow agencies and building community confidence that crime is preventable, can be dealt with through collaborative effort, education, and increased public awareness. 

Crime Prevention is defined as comprising strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring and their potential harmful effects on individuals and community, including fear of crime, by intervening to influence their multiple causes.

• Peace Area Drug Awareness Coalition was formed as a result of the opioid crisis to provide educational sessions and events to the public. At present, the Coalition’s mandate is expanding to include education and events on all substances;  this is to address Grande Prairie’s primary root cause of crime being substance use and abuse.

Volunteer Management:
Crime Prevention has a strong volunteer base, which allows the Department to maximize its program and service delivery to the community, even in times of limited resources.  Crime Prevention volunteers are an essential part of the Department’s successful operation. Volunteers have a passion for crime prevention and for making a positive difference in community, they act as local advocates for Crime Prevention programs, and help with marketing of events. 
The management of volunteers includes recruitment and coordination; volunteers undergo a hiring process including an interview, reference checks, and in some instances the completion of criminal record and intervention checks. Annual follow-ups with each volunteer takes place, training is offered periodically, and active volunteers are invited to an annual recognition event. 
Individuals of all ages volunteer with Crime Prevention including youth and seniors. Volunteering can take place in office or out in community. Volunteers help out with a range of activities such as weekly administrative tasks, helping run the resource library, set up/take down for the Cultural Integration Academy Educational sessions and childcare (while the latter is taking place). The set up/take down and registration for our monthly Lunch and Learns, preparation for tradeshows, performing safety audits and assisting with reporting, and helping to run community events such as neighbourhood BBQs. 
A number of Crime Prevention volunteers sit on various internal committees as well (i.e. the Crime Prevention Committee, the Peace Area Drug Awareness Coalition, the Annual Conference Planning Committee, and the Grande Prairie Intercultural Association, which was started under the Crime Prevention umbrella). 
Success as a City department, is in large thanks to the wonderful team of volunteers.

Community BBQ’s:
Crime Prevention will host neighbourhood BBQ events as a community connection activity. The aim is to develop community connections and contribute to building strong families, two key aspects to effectively preventing crime. Connections are fostered across the community, with activities for all age groups. 

National Addictions Awareness Week (NAAW):
For National Addictions Awareness Week (NAAW), Crime Prevention hosts a dinner at the Salvation Army for the high risk, street engaged community and vulnerable population in Grande Prairie. Encouraging inclusiveness and a sense of welcoming to all. Partner agencies and the RCMP attend the dinner to help with meal preparations and serving. The agencies, along with Crime Prevention, staff mingle with the individuals attending the dinner; this serves as an opportunity to connect with the street engaged population through meaningful dialogue, to gather information, and learn from the personal stories shared.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design programs look at early stage development plans, existing infrastructure, and consider the tangible changes that can be made to a physical space or object that can help to prevent or reduce the occurrences of crime at that site/area. 
Safety Audits (And the Review of Development and Subdivision Circulations):
 Safety audits can be conducted with any requesting business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association that want to enhance the safety of their site or area. A Safety audit is a tool to evaluate a physical a space with the goal of reducing crime and improving safety; 14 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles are used as the framework for the safety audits. Crime Prevention, as lead, along with business owners, staff, neighbourhood teams, and residents inspect the location together (e.g. its design, activity occurring in the space, users of the area, etc) and any adjacent areas. Actual crime as well as the perceived threat of crime are both taken into consideration; crime statistics as well as surveys are used to acquire this knowledge. Inspections of the site/area are done during the day and again at night and include a behavioural audit. Safety audits always include active engagement from the business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association; safety audits are not simply to improve the immediate safety of the site but also serve to teach people how to implement the principles on their own. A final report is prepared after each safety audit with recommendations and is presented to the requesting party.
Crime Prevention also reviews all proposed City Development Circulations to ensure that the principles of CPTED are met in the early stages of planning, development, and construction phases. 

GP HEAT:
Crime Prevention, Enforcement Services, the RCMP, and community volunteers team up to help prevent automobile theft. With the goal of prevention through education, GP HEAT helps to inform the public on how they can better protect their vehicles and valuables from theft. GP HEAT teams target commercial and residential areas to distribute Crime Prevention notices to all vehicles in that given area.  These notices provide general tips on how to reduce the likelihood of theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles. The notices also indicate whether each vehicle is an easy or a hard target – this allows the owner of the vehicle to learn about what a thief may consider when choosing their target. By providing vehicle-specific information, owners receive concrete direction on how they can better protect their possessions.

The Best Bar None:
 The Best Bar None is an Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC) program that Crime Prevention administers in Grande Prairie. Crime Prevention spear-heads the program, coordinates, and leads a local team of assessors that includes the RCMP, the Fire Department, and Enforcement Services. Grande Prairie is one of four cities in Alberta currently supporting the program. The program is a voluntary accreditation program recognizing excellence in Alberta’s liquor service industry. Participating establishments include bars, pubs, and clubs, lounges, casinos, restaurant lounges, and post-secondary drinking establishments. The Best Bar None aims to reduce alcohol-related incidences and enhance the safety of staff, patrons, and neighbouring residents/businesses. 
The team evaluates each establishment based on set criteria (e.g. safety procedures, capacity limits, staff training, building design, etc) that are established by the AGLC. The AGLC scores the team’s assessment of the criteria to determine if the establishment passes and can receive an accreditation. The final scores are presented to a steering committee who selects winners; the program recognizes and rewards the liquor service establishments that meet a higher standard of operation and safety. A recognition and accreditation presentation event is hosted annually. 

Neighbourhood Eye:
 The Neighbourhood Eye is a joint program between Crime Prevention and Neighbourhood Associations; it is a walking neighbourhood patrol initiative that allows residents to contribute to the prevention of crime and the general enhancement of their neighbourhoods. Individuals can identify anything that is not working, broken such as sidewalks needing repair, or is concerning including graffiti or suspicious activity.   Crime Prevention is the primary resource to the residents and can provide information and education when needed. Reporting is funnelled through Crime Prevention to either be addressed by one of Crime Prevention’s programs or disseminated to other resources such as the RCMP, Transportation, and Enforcement Services, etc. 

Graffiti Management Program:
 The graffiti Management Program is a joint initiative between Enforcement Services and Crime Prevention; through education and enforcement, the aim of the program is to reduce the amount of graffiti across the city and to help the identify taggers. A graffiti hotline and mobile app. (ARC) allows citizens to report areas that have been tagged with graffiti. Crime Prevention administers the program by receiving calls, collecting and compiling the data, and providing education to businesses and the broader community on what graffiti is, the importance of graffiti removal, and how to remove it.  Collected data is reviewed by Enforcement Services for further action. A mapping component allows for the locations of and patterns in the graffiti to be tracked. 

Utility Box Beautification Program:
 The Utility Box Beautification Program aims to deter graffiti, by covering what is considered to be a blank canvas for graffiti, and to beautify the community. The art selected to cover the City owned utility cabinets originates from local artists and photographers. Crime Prevention puts the call out to the community for art and photography. Submissions are reviewed/vetted and then presented to the Community Enhancement Advisory Committee and the Crime Prevention Committee to make the final selection.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

If a project is accepted into the program, a Project Manager will oversee the project throughout the entire development review process.  Projects generally consist of several permits or approvals and detailed review by other City departments or outside agencies.  The goal of this Program is to offer customers a central point of contact/resource within the City to connect with/through who will make sure all the right Departments, Agencies, Permits, etc. are considered and accessible.  This Program has been an invaluable resource for Customers since inception. 

The Project Manager’s Role:  The Project Manager acts as the central point of contact, opening the lines of communication by bringing an appropriate City Team together and greatly reducing the amount of time applicants spend going from Department to Department.  The Project Manager assists applicants in understanding the City’s requirements, which enables them to submit complete applications and avoid possible delays.  The Project Manager proactively monitors each project’s progress from Planning approvals to Certificate of Occupancy.  In some cases, a multi-disciplinary Team will be assigned to a project.  Team Members may include representatives from Current Planning, Design Review, Subdivisions, Plan Review, Fire, Public Works and a multitude of other disciplines.  The Project Manager will select the Team based on the scope of the project.

Early Assistance meetings are offered through the Project Management Program to identify required applications, establish project timelines and determine if there are any major issues that need to be addressed prior to application submittal.  One or more Early Assistance meetings may be held with varying City Team members.  Project Management is available on a limited basis.  Customers wishing to participate must contact a Project Manager and request consideration.  Projects must meet a specific criteria.  Project Managers have the option to decline an otherwise eligible project base on their workload capacity.  Eligible projects include:  Affordable or Workforce Housing; LEED projects certified as Silver or higher; Projects with challenging site issues (such as hillside or floodplain); Complex projects with phased permits; Difficult schedules; Inexperienced or non-local applicants; Economic Development; Civic Importance","43.5991","-116.2306",226570

Currie","The Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum is an international institute for experiential learning dedicated to Alberta's palaeontological heritage through research, collection, preservation, exhibition, public programming, publications and innovative outreach.  Before we were built, many of the fossils and dinosaur bones found in the northern regions of Alberta were sent south and east for research and display.  Our museum was built to provide a way in which research, education and impactful tourism opportunities could happen closer to home.

A regional Museum located in northwestern Alberta, we pride ourselves with providing an exceptional visitor experience that celebrates what is truly unique about the province of Alberta - dinosaurs.  No where else in Canada are these types of discoveries being made.  It is notable that our organization is located in very close proximity to the densest dinosaur bonebed in the world and we are leveraging that location by providing unique experiences including our Palaeontologist for a Day program, which has been widely received and provides income-generation for the Museum.  Along with summer camps, bonebed tours, corporate events and a wide range of educational and tourist-based experiences, we are making a name for the Peace Region in the field of Palaeontology like never before.

Located enroute to Mile Zero of the Alaska Highway, and part of a catchment area of over 250,000 strong, our organization is uniquely poised to further stimulate economic growth in the North, thus diversifying the region's financial prosperity.

We are proud of our achievements made thus far, and are eager to advance our strategic plan in the coming years with the support of the City of Grande Prairie and our other funding partners.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

We offer programs for all ages. Last year our youngest student was 3 and our most senior was 97 years young.  Over 10,000 people participated in our programing by taking a class, visiting our gallery or attending one of our events. Our community partners brought in another 5,000 visitors.

AGENT: 
AGENT is a joint program with the RCMP: Crime Prevention administers the program by providing education to the establishments, holding the AGENT signs and managing the database; the RCMP enacts the enforcement of the program. AGENT  enhances the safety of the staff and patrons of drinking establishments, liquor outlets, and other identified businesses by giving authority to the RCMP to act as agents on their behalf. Safety is increased by removing high risk individuals from the premises and by doing so in a way that eliminates the risk to staff/patrons by ensuring anonymity when calls for service are required. AGENT allows the RCMP to enter the premises and remove individuals such as gang members, high-risk offenders, and wanted individuals. Other actions within the scope of authority of the RCMP may also be taken, including making arrests, issuing permanent bans, and laying charges under the Trespass Act, Petty Trespass Act, Gaming and Liquor Act, and relevant Municipal Bylaws.

Report a Drug House (RDH):
 Report a Drug House is a partnership between the RCMP, a joint police task force known as Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods (SCAN), Enforcement Services and Crime Prevention. RDH allows residents to call a confidential line to report suspected illegal drug activity in a residence. Crime Prevention receives the calls, collects the necessary information, compiles a report, distributes the data to the appropriate policing sources, and provides education to the Community regarding the program.  

Report a John:
 Report a John is a joint initiative between the RCMP and Crime Prevention that allows residents to call an confidential line and report suspected ‘Johns’ in the community. Crime Prevention receives the call, collects the data, compiles the report, distributes the information to the RCMP, and educates the community on the program. If a ‘John’ is charged, this may result in the individual being required to participate in the Sex Trade Offender Program (STOP), a program in which Crime Prevention is a partner.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design programs look at early stage development plans, existing infrastructure, and consider the tangible changes that can be made to a physical space or object that can help to prevent or reduce the occurrences of crime at that site/area. 
Safety Audits (And the Review of Development and Subdivision Circulations):
 Safety audits can be conducted with any requesting business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association that want to enhance the safety of their site or area. A Safety audit is a tool to evaluate a physical a space with the goal of reducing crime and improving safety; 14 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles are used as the framework for the safety audits. Crime Prevention, as lead, along with business owners, staff, neighbourhood teams, and residents inspect the location together (e.g. its design, activity occurring in the space, users of the area, etc) and any adjacent areas. Actual crime as well as the perceived threat of crime are both taken into consideration; crime statistics as well as surveys are used to acquire this knowledge. Inspections of the site/area are done during the day and again at night and include a behavioural audit. Safety audits always include active engagement from the business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association; safety audits are not simply to improve the immediate safety of the site but also serve to teach people how to implement the principles on their own. A final report is prepared after each safety audit with recommendations and is presented to the requesting party.
Crime Prevention also reviews all proposed City Development Circulations to ensure that the principles of CPTED are met in the early stages of planning, development, and construction phases. 

GP HEAT:
Crime Prevention, Enforcement Services, the RCMP, and community volunteers team up to help prevent automobile theft. With the goal of prevention through education, GP HEAT helps to inform the public on how they can better protect their vehicles and valuables from theft. GP HEAT teams target commercial and residential areas to distribute Crime Prevention notices to all vehicles in that given area.  These notices provide general tips on how to reduce the likelihood of theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles. The notices also indicate whether each vehicle is an easy or a hard target – this allows the owner of the vehicle to learn about what a thief may consider when choosing their target. By providing vehicle-specific information, owners receive concrete direction on how they can better protect their possessions.

The Best Bar None:
 The Best Bar None is an Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC) program that Crime Prevention administers in Grande Prairie. Crime Prevention spear-heads the program, coordinates, and leads a local team of assessors that includes the RCMP, the Fire Department, and Enforcement Services. Grande Prairie is one of four cities in Alberta currently supporting the program. The program is a voluntary accreditation program recognizing excellence in Alberta’s liquor service industry. Participating establishments include bars, pubs, and clubs, lounges, casinos, restaurant lounges, and post-secondary drinking establishments. The Best Bar None aims to reduce alcohol-related incidences and enhance the safety of staff, patrons, and neighbouring residents/businesses. 
The team evaluates each establishment based on set criteria (e.g. safety procedures, capacity limits, staff training, building design, etc) that are established by the AGLC. The AGLC scores the team’s assessment of the criteria to determine if the establishment passes and can receive an accreditation. The final scores are presented to a steering committee who selects winners; the program recognizes and rewards the liquor service establishments that meet a higher standard of operation and safety. A recognition and accreditation presentation event is hosted annually. 

Neighbourhood Eye:
 The Neighbourhood Eye is a joint program between Crime Prevention and Neighbourhood Associations; it is a walking neighbourhood patrol initiative that allows residents to contribute to the prevention of crime and the general enhancement of their neighbourhoods. Individuals can identify anything that is not working, broken such as sidewalks needing repair, or is concerning including graffiti or suspicious activity.   Crime Prevention is the primary resource to the residents and can provide information and education when needed. Reporting is funnelled through Crime Prevention to either be addressed by one of Crime Prevention’s programs or disseminated to other resources such as the RCMP, Transportation, and Enforcement Services, etc. 

Graffiti Management Program:
 The graffiti Management Program is a joint initiative between Enforcement Services and Crime Prevention; through education and enforcement, the aim of the program is to reduce the amount of graffiti across the city and to help the identify taggers. A graffiti hotline and mobile app. (ARC) allows citizens to report areas that have been tagged with graffiti. Crime Prevention administers the program by receiving calls, collecting and compiling the data, and providing education to businesses and the broader community on what graffiti is, the importance of graffiti removal, and how to remove it.  Collected data is reviewed by Enforcement Services for further action. A mapping component allows for the locations of and patterns in the graffiti to be tracked. 

Utility Box Beautification Program:
 The Utility Box Beautification Program aims to deter graffiti, by covering what is considered to be a blank canvas for graffiti, and to beautify the community. The art selected to cover the City owned utility cabinets originates from local artists and photographers. Crime Prevention puts the call out to the community for art and photography. Submissions are reviewed/vetted and then presented to the Community Enhancement Advisory Committee and the Crime Prevention Committee to make the final selection.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166

In addition         By Law 1265 establishes the Transit System. Reliance: Due to the nature of the system there are no providers located outside of the City, however there are alternate providers within the City Cost Recovery: Currently 15-16% PopServed: The transit system is within a 400m walking distance of 90% of the population. Demand: No change in the demand over the past year. Demand has a high correlation to the economy/population of Grande Prairie. Community: Transit provides the ability for all people to take part in community programs, recreational and cultural opportunities. Economy: Transit contributes positively to a growing economy. A transit system can be a determining factor in people’s relocation decisions and is viewed as a service that a stable and well planned City should offer. Providing transit to link people to their employment and education as well as new residential developments can attract potential residents to our City. Infrastructure: As the City grows so should Transit to ensure that the level of service keeps pace with the demand and expectations of people who wish to locate to our community. The expectation of a mid-sized community is that they provide safe travel and mobility options for its residents. Safety: Provision of Transit promotes a safe travel alternative for those who have no other options or who choose to utilize public transit. It forms part of a package of services offered by cities who endorse a holistic vision of community.

This makes for a more inclusive community. Reliance: This service is currently operated by a non-profit entity, however the City does provide a substantial operating subsidy in addition to in-kind services. Cost Recovery: Currently 8%. This figure includes all expenses including in kind and only takes into consideration the actual revenue from fares. PopServed: DTS as a door to door service covers the entire city as well as trips to the County areas located within 5 km of City limits. Demand: Demand has been continually increasing each year as the population ages. Community: DTS provides the opportunity for all people regardless of mobility to take part in community programs, recreational and cultural opportunities. This assists the City in its vision to be inclusive. Economy: DTS is one of the few transportation links available for those with accessibility issues or disabilities to integrate and be part of the community. It allows their patrons access to employment and social activities. Infrastructure: As the population ages the demand for DTS services increases.

Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design programs look at early stage development plans, existing infrastructure, and consider the tangible changes that can be made to a physical space or object that can help to prevent or reduce the occurrences of crime at that site/area. 
Safety Audits (And the Review of Development and Subdivision Circulations):
 Safety audits can be conducted with any requesting business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association that want to enhance the safety of their site or area. A Safety audit is a tool to evaluate a physical a space with the goal of reducing crime and improving safety; 14 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles are used as the framework for the safety audits. Crime Prevention, as lead, along with business owners, staff, neighbourhood teams, and residents inspect the location together (e.g. its design, activity occurring in the space, users of the area, etc) and any adjacent areas. Actual crime as well as the perceived threat of crime are both taken into consideration; crime statistics as well as surveys are used to acquire this knowledge. Inspections of the site/area are done during the day and again at night and include a behavioural audit. Safety audits always include active engagement from the business, not-for-profit, or Neighbourhood Association; safety audits are not simply to improve the immediate safety of the site but also serve to teach people how to implement the principles on their own. A final report is prepared after each safety audit with recommendations and is presented to the requesting party.
Crime Prevention also reviews all proposed City Development Circulations to ensure that the principles of CPTED are met in the early stages of planning, development, and construction phases. 

GP HEAT:
Crime Prevention, Enforcement Services, the RCMP, and community volunteers team up to help prevent automobile theft. With the goal of prevention through education, GP HEAT helps to inform the public on how they can better protect their vehicles and valuables from theft. GP HEAT teams target commercial and residential areas to distribute Crime Prevention notices to all vehicles in that given area.  These notices provide general tips on how to reduce the likelihood of theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles. The notices also indicate whether each vehicle is an easy or a hard target – this allows the owner of the vehicle to learn about what a thief may consider when choosing their target. By providing vehicle-specific information, owners receive concrete direction on how they can better protect their possessions.

The Best Bar None:
 The Best Bar None is an Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission (AGLC) program that Crime Prevention administers in Grande Prairie. Crime Prevention spear-heads the program, coordinates, and leads a local team of assessors that includes the RCMP, the Fire Department, and Enforcement Services. Grande Prairie is one of four cities in Alberta currently supporting the program. The program is a voluntary accreditation program recognizing excellence in Alberta’s liquor service industry. Participating establishments include bars, pubs, and clubs, lounges, casinos, restaurant lounges, and post-secondary drinking establishments. The Best Bar None aims to reduce alcohol-related incidences and enhance the safety of staff, patrons, and neighbouring residents/businesses. 
The team evaluates each establishment based on set criteria (e.g. safety procedures, capacity limits, staff training, building design, etc) that are established by the AGLC. The AGLC scores the team’s assessment of the criteria to determine if the establishment passes and can receive an accreditation. The final scores are presented to a steering committee who selects winners; the program recognizes and rewards the liquor service establishments that meet a higher standard of operation and safety. A recognition and accreditation presentation event is hosted annually. 

Neighbourhood Eye:
 The Neighbourhood Eye is a joint program between Crime Prevention and Neighbourhood Associations; it is a walking neighbourhood patrol initiative that allows residents to contribute to the prevention of crime and the general enhancement of their neighbourhoods. Individuals can identify anything that is not working, broken such as sidewalks needing repair, or is concerning including graffiti or suspicious activity.   Crime Prevention is the primary resource to the residents and can provide information and education when needed. Reporting is funnelled through Crime Prevention to either be addressed by one of Crime Prevention’s programs or disseminated to other resources such as the RCMP, Transportation, and Enforcement Services, etc. 

Graffiti Management Program:
 The graffiti Management Program is a joint initiative between Enforcement Services and Crime Prevention; through education and enforcement, the aim of the program is to reduce the amount of graffiti across the city and to help the identify taggers. A graffiti hotline and mobile app. (ARC) allows citizens to report areas that have been tagged with graffiti. Crime Prevention administers the program by receiving calls, collecting and compiling the data, and providing education to businesses and the broader community on what graffiti is, the importance of graffiti removal, and how to remove it.  Collected data is reviewed by Enforcement Services for further action. A mapping component allows for the locations of and patterns in the graffiti to be tracked. 

Utility Box Beautification Program:
 The Utility Box Beautification Program aims to deter graffiti, by covering what is considered to be a blank canvas for graffiti, and to beautify the community. The art selected to cover the City owned utility cabinets originates from local artists and photographers. Crime Prevention puts the call out to the community for art and photography. Submissions are reviewed/vetted and then presented to the Community Enhancement Advisory Committee and the Crime Prevention Committee to make the final selection.","55.170833","-118.794722",63166
