The second week of the program saw a tripling of calls being diverted away from our Sworn officers, and we expect that number to rise even greater under our current CSO staffing level, and further still with an expanded CSO staffing level.
Once we obtain, and start implementing, a new RMS, and also gain some stability with the expansion of CSO’s duties, we expect to be better equipped at making management decisions on service level changes.
